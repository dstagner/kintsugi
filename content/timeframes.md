title: Timeframes
---

I find it useful to think of time in two order of magnitude chunks. 

- **Day/week (now):**
- **Year (short time):**
- **Century (generational time):**
- **10,000 years (civilizational time):**
- **1 million years (evolutionary time):** It seems likely to me that human civilization will still exist a million years from now. 
- **100 million years (geological time):** Itâ€™s quite possible that human civilization will still exist 100 million years from now. Certainly, other species have lasted that long, without our advantages. 
- **10 billion years (cosmic time):**
