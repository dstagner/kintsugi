# Remediation

> Survival is insufficient.
> - Emily St. John Mandel, *Station 11*

Imagine we stopped burning fossil fuel and achieved Net Zero tomorrow. For thousands of years before the start of the widespread use of fossil fuel, Earth’s atmosphere was close to 280ppm CO2. At the time of this writing, it is nearly 430ppm. It would still be 430ppm for a *long* time to come - thousands of years of melting glaciers, ocean acidification, thawing permafrost, and more. 

And that’s just one of many global ecological catastrophes we have experienced since the start of the Industrial Age. River deltas, toxic waste dumps, unexploded ordinance, microplastics, extinctions, habitat loss... all the harm we have caused the biosphere that reduces the quality of human life.  

We have a moral obligation to future generations to remediate as much of the damage as possible - even if we weren’t the ones to cause the damage. 

## Atmosphere
Atmospheric damage is global, not local. It affects everyone, everywhere, every ecosystem, land and sea. It is not a problem of just one location, one country, or one people. 

The most immediate, most pressing, and most dangerous ecological [overshoot](overshoot.md) is climate change, caused by greenhouse gases produced by human activity, primarily burning fossil fuels. 

Although there are many greenhouse gases, the two most important ones are CO2 and methane. Let’s start with methane, because it’s easier to address. 

1. Atmosphere: CO2, methane, aerosols, restoring pre-industrial atmospheric balance. Focus: Realistic carbon capture methods.
2. Waters: Rivers, lakes, deltas, aquifers, oceans (glaciers?). Restoring free water movement, chemistry, sediment flows. Case study: Mississippi and Mekong deltas.
3. Soil: Topsoil, fertility, microbes, toxins. Healing the interface between geology and biology. 
4. Life: Biodiversity and habitat. Reflection: Extinction, rewilding, invasive species. 
5. Culture: (optional) Restoring community, connection, and purpose that have been disrupted by industrial entertainment and unnatural urban design. Contrast: New Urbanism and walkable cities, versus cities abandoned due to unrepairable ecological damage, such as Chernobyl.
