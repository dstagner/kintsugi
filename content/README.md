As I’ve worked on the MET project, I’ve found it to be sprawl and chaos that defies the sort of structured presentation of an outline - and my scattershot, ADHD-driven writing approach doesn’t help. The same linearity problem makes the idea of straightforward blogging a problem. 

So I’m going to try organizing it, at least for now, as a digital garden, get a publishing workflow going, and turn this into something the rest of the world can see, even in its seed stage.
