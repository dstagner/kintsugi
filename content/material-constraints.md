| M Category                   | Physical Behavior                                                                                            | Constraint Type                                               | Scarcity→Abundance Path                                                           | True Abundance Possible?                                                                       | Key MET Dynamics                                                                        |

| Metals                       | Durable, non-perishable, recyclable with low quality loss.                                                   | Stock-limited — total in-use stock sets replacement needs.    | Scarcity → Sufficiency → Abundance once recycling + in-use stock cover needs.     | Yes, with high loop efficiency and declining population.                                       | Mining fades after abundance point; T focuses on recovery, sorting, metallurgy.         |
| Non-metallic Minerals        | Mixed: some recyclable (glass, silicon), some dissipative (cement), some biologically critical (phosphorus). | Mixed — partly stock-limited, partly flow-limited.            | Some can reach abundance (glass), others always scarce (nutrients).               | Partial — depends on material type.                                                            | Abundant-E can make low-grade ore usable; nutrient loops must close to avoid scarcity.  |
| Biomass                      | Renewable flow if harvest ≤ regrowth; perishable; land- and water-dependent.                                 | Flow-limited — constrained by annual biological productivity. | Sufficiency possible; abundance only in narrow uses without ecological harm.      | Partial — food always constrained biologically; wood/fiber can be abundant with good land use. | Overharvest creates false abundance; population decline eases pressure.                 |
| Fresh Water                  | Renewable through hydrological cycle; quality varies; locally scarce.                                        | Flow & location-limited — availability mismatched to demand.  | Local scarcity persists; sufficiency possible with abundant-E desalination/reuse. | Partial — agriculture remains constrained by soil-water ecology.                               | E removes many industrial/urban limits; governance and ecology constrain ag use.        |
| Fossil Hydrocarbons (legacy) | Finite stock; destroyed when burned; some non-energy uses.                                                   | Stock-limited & dissipative — non-renewable.                  | False abundance until depletion; no path to true abundance.                       | No — inherently finite.                                                                        | Reserve for high-value chemical uses; replace energy role with renewables + synthetics. |
| Land                         | Fixed area; quality/location vary; non-transportable.                                                        | Positional — specific sites are inherently scarce.            | Scarcity persists for desirable sites; sufficiency possible for basic needs.      | No — universal abundance impossible.                                                           | High-value land always contested; managed by complex cultural technics (law, zoning).   |
