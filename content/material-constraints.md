title: Materials and Their Constraints
---

There’s a tendency in the literature to lump all materials and energy together as “resources”. *Limits of Growth* is a prime example. But different categories of materials have very different behaviors and constraints. Making distinctions is necessary for sorting out the potential for true abundance from false abundance.

## Metals
Metals can and likely will be true abundance. Metals are fully recyclable, durable and non-perishable, and there is an upper bound to the per-capita needs of any given metal. Moreover, recycled metals are less expensive than newly mined metals, so there’s a strong incentive to recycle. 

Together, this suggests that at some point, we will have mined *enough* of each metal, and demand will be sourced almost entirely from a circular recycling flow. 

## Biomass
The “circle of life” is naturally a circular flow. Plants grow by consuming CO2 and H2O, transforming them into organic molecules via photosynthesis. Animals eat plants or other animals to produce more organic molecules, and fungi and other kingdoms participate in the flow as well. And, which each plant or animal dies, their remains are decomposed back into CO2 and H2O. So biomass is, naturally, a true abundance. 

But we don’t just want “biomass”. We want oak wood, or hamburger, or other specific kinds, which are regionally limited. By agriculture, we create additional desirable biomass, and suppress unwanted kinds of biomass. In extreme cases, this can lead to extinctions. And given the intensity with which we have converted land to agriculture, the whole world is now an extreme case.

## Fresh Water

## Fossil hydrocarbons

## Land

| Metals                       | Durable, non-perishable, recyclable with low quality loss.                                                   | Stock-limited — total in-use stock sets replacement needs.    | Scarcity → Sufficiency → Abundance once recycling + in-use stock cover needs.     | Yes, with high loop efficiency and declining population.                                       | Mining fades after abundance point; T focuses on recovery, sorting, metallurgy.         |
| Non-metallic Minerals        | Mixed: some recyclable (glass, silicon), some dissipative (cement), some biologically critical (phosphorus). | Mixed — partly stock-limited, partly flow-limited.            | Some can reach abundance (glass), others always scarce (nutrients).               | Partial — depends on material type.                                                            | Abundant-E can make low-grade ore usable; nutrient loops must close to avoid scarcity.  |
| Biomass                      | Renewable flow if harvest ≤ regrowth; perishable; land- and water-dependent.                                 | Flow-limited — constrained by annual biological productivity. | Sufficiency possible; abundance only in narrow uses without ecological harm.      | Partial — food always constrained biologically; wood/fiber can be abundant with good land use. | Overharvest creates false abundance; population decline eases pressure.                 |
| Fresh Water                  | Renewable through hydrological cycle; quality varies; locally scarce.                                        | Flow & location-limited — availability mismatched to demand.  | Local scarcity persists; sufficiency possible with abundant-E desalination/reuse. | Partial — agriculture remains constrained by soil-water ecology.                               | E removes many industrial/urban limits; governance and ecology constrain ag use.        |
| Fossil Hydrocarbons (legacy) | Finite stock; destroyed when burned; some non-energy uses.                                                   | Stock-limited & dissipative — non-renewable.                  | False abundance until depletion; no path to true abundance.                       | No — inherently finite.                                                                        | Reserve for high-value chemical uses; replace energy role with renewables + synthetics. |
| Land                         | Fixed area; quality/location vary; non-transportable.                                                        | Positional — specific sites are inherently scarce.            | Scarcity persists for desirable sites; sufficiency possible for basic needs.      | No — universal abundance impossible.                                                           | High-value land always contested; managed by complex cultural technics (law, zoning).   |
