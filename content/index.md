## …work worthy of the name “human”

> To learn to meet our needs without continuous violence against one another and our only world would require an immense intellectual and practical effort, requiring the help of every human being perhaps to the end of human time. This would be work worthy of the name “human.” It would be fascinating and lovely.
> - Wendell Berry

In many ways, our world is broken. That does not mean it cannot be repaired. The world can be repaired. But some cracks will show.

Kintsugi is a Japanese art form for repairing broken pottery. The adhesive used to mend it is filled with gold, so rather than trying (and failing) to achieve an invisible repair, it highlights the repair, and makes it beautiful. To see Kintsugi pottery is to see something that has,,,,m. n been broken, but has been made whole again, in a way perhaps more beautiful than it was before it broke.

What we choose to do this year, this decade, this century, will have repercussions that could impact human civilization for thousands or even millions of years. Not in a chaos theory “butterfly flapping its wings in China” sense, but in concrete and predictable ways.

The physical world in which we live is made of materials. Humans shape those materials by applying energy, under direction of technics.
