title: “MET: Materials, Energy, Technics”
---

MET (Materials, Energy, Technics) is a framework for understanding the physical basis of human civilization. It is a framework for understanding the interactions, relationships, and feedback loops between these three factors. Our physical civilization is made of materials, shaped by energy, guided by technics. 

Without Energy, Materials are just nature. Without Technics, Energy is undirected. Without Materials, Technics has nothing to do. 

A new Technics breakthrough can produce things that could not be produced before, or produce things more effectively, using the same M and E inputs. A Material constraint can limit what Technics can accomplish in practice. More Energy allows more or _different_ Technics to be applied to Materials. If you don’t have iron ore, you can’t make steel, even if you know how. If you don’t have the ability to produce a consistent 1500c heat source, you can’t make steel, even if you have the know-how and the iron ore. And if you don’t know how to make steel, it doesn’t matter if you have the ore and can produce the required temperatures. 

MET is descriptive rather than prescriptive. It doesn’t tell us what actions to take. It only tells us the potential consequences of actions we may take, and how previous actions led to human civilization being what it is today.

## Materials

Materials is a broad and complex concept. In the historic literature of similar ideas, materials and energy are often lumped together as “resources”. This has led to overly broad generalizations. For example, fresh water is a material, and iron ore is a material. But each one is used in completely different ways, has wildly different behaviors in terms of usage patterns and sustainability, has different constraints and presents different opportunities. 

## Energy

Energy is much more simple. It has a limited number of forms - electricity, heat, magnetism, chemical bonds, gravity, etc. Many of these are easily exchanged for other forms. For example, light energy can be easily converted into electrical energy, and electrical energy can be easily converted into light. So energy operates under very different constrains than materials.

## Technics

Technics is all forms of shared human knowledge. So it’s not just technology, but also things like language and culture. Technics is what separates humans from other animals.
