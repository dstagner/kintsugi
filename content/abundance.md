# Abundance

## True abundance and false abundance
True abundance is the result of flows. 

False abundance looks like abundance in the short term, but the material in question is consumed in ways that make it impossible or impractical to recover. For example, at present, the supply of fossil fuels outstrips demand, so much so that producers work together in cartels to keep prices up by artificially limiting supply. But over long enough - and “long enough” is mere centuries, perhaps mere decades - fossil fuel will become scarce enough that what remains cannot be recovered in an energy-positive fashion. So fossil fuel is a false abundance. 

## Scarcity
The opposite of abundance is scarcity. That’s when available resources are insufficient to meet needs, much less wants.
