# Mining the Anthropocene

In 1856, Henry Bessemer first demonstrated his modern process for making steel from pig iron. By 1858, his first steel mill was operating in Sheffield, England. In 1865, the first Bessemer-style steel mill started in the US, based on a patent by William Kelly. Steel became one of the “Big Three” materials of modern industrialism, along with Portland cement (concrete), and plastics. Billions of tons of steel have been produced. And most of it gets recycled.

In the USA, over 95% of the steel in scrapped cars is recycled. With high rates of recycling from other sources, like construction waste, packaging, and appliances, the vast majority (70-75%) of the steel used in new manufacturing is from recycled steel. Aluminum is also heavily recycled. This is in part an economic incentive - recycled metals are less expensive than virgin metal, because they don’t need expensive mining and refining processes. Just melt them back down. In the case of aluminum, it takes 14-15MWh of energy to make a ton of aluminum from bauxite ore, but only 0.7MWh to melt down a ton of scrap aluminum for re-casting. 

Similar logic applies to less common metals being scrapped, from copper to gold and beyond. And it applies to modern batteries as well. The critical materials of li-ion batteries are relatively rare metals like lithium, cobalt, and nickel - all recyclable. At this point, there aren’t enough EVs being scrapped to produce a significant recycling flow, but as the number of EVs grows and the EVs out there are eventually scrapped, the batteries will be fed into a highly efficient recycling flow. Eventually, the number of new EVs will more or less match the number of scrapped EVs, and the flow will be nearly circular. A similar process will happen for grid-scale batteries, which also come neatly packaged in storage containers to make disposal by recycling very easy. Which leads us to our next idea.

Consider these two statements:

1. There is an upper limit to how much of any given metal we need per capita. 
2. There is an upper limit to the human population on Earth, and we may be very close to the greatest number of living humans that will ever exist, when the population peaks around 10 billion later this century. 

Together, these tell us that there is an upper limit to how much of any given metal humanity will *ever* need. Which means, as recycling rates approach 100%, we will reach a point where almost no metals need to be mined at all anymore.
